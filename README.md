# First school Java project -- Maritime transport (container ship and containers)
* Firstly, we had to create our own hierarchy of containers classes and realistic container ship.
* Secondly, write to a txt file a list of 15000 randomly generated container objects (with random values).
* Next we had to read them from the txt file and sort them in our own way to prevent any dangerous situations caused by poor mass location on the ship.
* Then, we had to load the containers right on the board of the ship.
* Last step was to create manifest file (in this case it was another txt file), which had to have data about every container on a board (number, position, total mass and product).
